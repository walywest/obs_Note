//FIX: ====>> Hello Abderrahmane, We need to qualify if Keycloak can meet the
//     requirements below for an identity and access management.
//     Could you please check these requirements and let me know if any of
//     them cannot be met when using Keycloak. (SDID is the system to be
//     implemented. it stands for Single digital identity. It shouldn’t be
//     confused with IAM/IDAM)

//NOTE:====>> IDAM (Identity and access management) module will facilitate the
//            management of digital identities of officials, service providers (mostly
//            public sector), system administrators, partners (Mostly public sector)
//            and other individuals authorized to access the SDID system and manage
//            access to various features of the SDID system. This module shall
//            facilitate authentication and authorization of computers and other
//            network devices used by different users by assigning and enforcing
//            security policies. In addition, it will also help create and manage
//            service accounts belonging to parts of the SDID system, third party
//            applications or components that interact with or operate as part of the
//            SDID system. Framework of processes and technologies to ensure that the
//            right person has access to the right technology resources should be
//            enforced.
